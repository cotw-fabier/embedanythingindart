# Vector Embeddings in Machine Learning

## What are Vector Embeddings?

Vector embeddings are **numerical representations** of data that capture semantic meaning in a high-dimensional space. They transform complex objects like text, images, or graphs into dense vectors of real numbers.

## Why are Embeddings Important?

Embeddings enable machine learning models to:

- Compare semantic similarity between different objects
- Reduce dimensionality while preserving meaning
- Enable transfer learning across tasks
- Power recommendation systems and search engines

## Common Embedding Techniques

### Word Embeddings

Word2Vec and GloVe pioneered the idea of representing words as vectors where similar words have similar vector representations.

### Sentence Embeddings

Modern approaches like **BERT** and **Sentence-BERT** create embeddings for entire sentences, capturing context and meaning beyond individual words.

### Multimodal Embeddings

Recent models like CLIP can create embeddings that work across different modalities, mapping images and text into the same vector space.

## Applications

1. **Semantic Search**: Find documents based on meaning, not just keywords
2. **Recommendation Systems**: Suggest similar items based on embedding proximity
3. **Clustering**: Group similar items together automatically
4. **Anomaly Detection**: Identify outliers in the embedding space

Embeddings are the foundation of modern AI systems, enabling machines to understand and work with human concepts in a mathematical framework.
