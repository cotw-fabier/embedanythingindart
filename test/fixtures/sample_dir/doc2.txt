Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of AI that helps computers understand, interpret, and generate human language.

NLP powers many applications we use daily, including machine translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots, and text summarization. Modern NLP relies heavily on transformer architectures and attention mechanisms.

The field has seen remarkable progress with models like GPT, BERT, and T5 that can perform multiple language tasks with minimal fine-tuning.
