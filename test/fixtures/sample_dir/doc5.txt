Transformers and Attention

The Transformer architecture introduced the attention mechanism, allowing models to weigh the importance of different parts of the input when making predictions.

Unlike recurrent networks, Transformers can process entire sequences in parallel, making them much faster to train. Self-attention enables the model to relate different positions in a sequence to compute representations.

This architecture has become the foundation for state-of-the-art models in NLP, computer vision, and beyond.
