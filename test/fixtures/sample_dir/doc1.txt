Introduction to Neural Networks

Neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks in animal brains. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information.

Each neuron receives inputs, applies a mathematical transformation, and produces an output. Through training, the network learns to adjust connection weights to minimize errors in its predictions.

Deep neural networks with many layers have revolutionized fields like computer vision and natural language processing.
