# Deep Learning Fundamentals

## Overview

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers (hence "deep").

## Key Concepts

- **Layers**: Input, hidden, and output layers process data sequentially
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear functions like ReLU and sigmoid
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for training networks by computing gradients
- **Optimization**: Methods like Adam and SGD for updating weights

## Applications

Deep learning excels at tasks involving:
- Image recognition and classification
- Speech recognition and synthesis
- Natural language understanding
- Game playing (AlphaGo, chess engines)
