# Transfer Learning

Transfer learning is a technique where a model trained on one task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task.

## Benefits

1. **Faster Training**: Leverage pre-trained weights instead of starting from scratch
2. **Better Performance**: Especially useful when you have limited training data
3. **Resource Efficiency**: Requires less computational power and data

## Common Approaches

- Fine-tuning pre-trained models
- Feature extraction using frozen layers
- Domain adaptation techniques

Transfer learning has become the standard approach in computer vision and NLP.
