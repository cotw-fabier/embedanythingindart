Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning enables computers to learn from data without explicit programming.
It uses algorithms to identify patterns and make predictions.

Key concepts include:
- Supervised learning: Learning from labeled data
- Unsupervised learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- Reinforcement learning: Learning through trial and error

Applications span from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles.
